# TalaMT
Repo for paper "TalaMT: Multilingual Machine Translation for Cabécar-Bribri-Spanish" (accepted to MRL 2023 Workshop, co-hosted with EMNLP 2023).

Project led by Alex Jones, advised by Rolando Coto-Solano at Dartmouth College. In collaboration with Guillermo González Campos at the University of Costa Rica.

This repo contains:
* Pretrained PyTorch machine translation models that translate the indigenous Costa Rican languages Cabécar and Bribri into and out of Spanish. These models may be used with the package OpenNMT.
* A BPE tokenizer for processing Cabécar, Bribri, and Spanish text
* Code snippets in Google Colab demonstrating how the models and tokenizer may be used with OpenNMT
